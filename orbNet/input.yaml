device: 'cuda'
model: 'orb-v1'
# Available:
# orb-v1: trained on MPTraj + Alexandria.
# orb-mptraj-only-v1: trained on the MPTraj dataset only to reproduce our second Matbench Discovery result. We do not recommend using this model for general use.
# orb-d3-v1: trained on MPTraj + Alexandria with integrated D3 corrections. In general, we recommend using this model, particularly for systems where dispersion interactions are important. This model was trained to predict D3-corrected targets and hence is the same speed as orb-v1. Incorporating D3 into the model like this is substantially faster than using analytical D3 corrections.
# orb-d3-{sm,xs}-v1: Smaller versions of orb-d3-v1. The sm model has 10 layers, whilst the xs model has 5 layers.
